# Welcome to Harjot's Final Project Page! 

This website has been created by Harjot Shoker as part of the **Patterns in the Pandemic** module of INSPIRE 1A03. 
I hope you enjoy reading and observing all the graphs and charts I made for this course as much as I enjoyed creating them! COVID-19 has been a difficult time for all, and with the rise of the pandemic, data analysis is more important then ever to ensure such unprecedented times are dealt with effectively.
