# Welcome to Harjot's Final Project Page! 

This website has been created by Harjot Shoker as part of the **Patterns in the Pandemic** module of INSPIRE 1A03. 

I hope you enjoy reading and observing all the graphs and charts I made for this course as much as I enjoyed creating them! 
COVID-19 has been such an challenging time, especially as students and teachers having to adapt to this new virutal learning environment while dealing with the effects of COVID-19 has been a struggle least to say. You should all be so proud of yourself for learning during such unprecedented times! 

I wanted to provide you all with a little something I feel like is helped me during these times. It's nothing special, you may use this as well! While doing my work, or just reading, I love to have white noise in the background in the shape of rain and nature sounds. For some odd reason, they have always been so soothing for me, and works as a way to eliminate any stress or anxiety I may be feeling that day. 

Feel free to click on this video and listen while reading all these very important data analysis!
