#### Summary
The first figure is illustrating the trends in Canada with regards to COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths since the pandemic started. The diagram showcases information regarding the impact of daily new cases on hospitalizations and fatalities. 


## 2. Ontario's testing and vaccination trends 
> Q2: How has Ontario responded to COVID in terms of testing and vaccinations?

#### Summary
The figure showcases that Ontario had a slow start in terms of testing and vaccinations. That it was not until after the New Year, that more tests were being conducted. In addition, the graph illustrates that the bulk of the vaccinations only started happening in the month of April 2021.

## 3. Vaccination rates across provinces and territories
> Q3: How do vaccination rates over time compare between all provinces and territories?

#### Summary
The figure decribes how vaccinations in the terrorities are significantly higher than the provinces. The provinces have been quite close with one another in their rate of vaccinations throughout the course of the timeline, whereas the terrorities have large rates of vaccinations rates.

## 4. Canadian mobility trends 
> Q4. How has mobility changed in Canada over the pandemic?

#### Summary
**The diagram showcases that most Canadians have resorted to attending parks significantly more than any other form of recreation. The high peak is majorly only during the months of Spring/Summer however. Mobility transit rates have decreased the most,whereas the rest have been more stagant on the baseline. **

## Final reflection
> * What inferences can you make from the data you have explored and visualized?  
> * What questions still exist about the trends and the data? What new questions has this process generated? 
> * What additional information would you like to help answer these questions? 

1. **The first figure is illustrating the trends** in Canada with regards to COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths since the pandemic started. The graphic illustrates that in the beginning of the pandemic, the daily fatalities were quite high, and gradually as the first wave ended, the less daily cases and hospitalizations there were. I can infer through the dates that with each new wave, second or third, the daily cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities expontentially increases. An interesting aspect to note is that as the vaccine rollout panned out throughout the 2021 months, there was much less hospitalizations and death caused, regardless of the fact that daily cases were still high. As a result, I can infer that the vaccine rollout plan has helped significantly in limiting fatalities from COVID-19. I geniunely felt like this graph was quite straight forward and I had no new questions regarding the trends and data. 

2. **The second figure is analyzing** how Ontario responded to COVID in terms of testing and vaccinations. I can infer from the graph that Ontario did not have an effective plan in regards to COVID-19 in relation to testing and vaccinations as the first months were quite low. It is evident that it was only starting the month of April, that the vaccine rollout in Ontario started to increase per 100 people. In addition, the line is continually increasing higher with testing, meaning that it was only with later dates, that the testing was happen much more often. One new question I had about the trends and data would have to be the status of thetesting. How many of the tests ultimtately ended up being negative or positive? Including addtianl information about the sign of the tests, I feel like that would be a very cruical factor to make in this graph, and come to a very fascinating dicussion. 

3. **The third figure is illustrating** the vaccination rates over time compare between all provinces and territories. While observing the graphic I can notice that the provinces are much more clustered together and have a smaller standard deviation between the two when place in comparsion with the terrorities which are much more dispersed and spread out. I can infer that the terrorities have been much more effective with their vaccine rollout plan as they have been majorly much higher in their rate than the provinces. However, it is fascinating to note how Nunavut is quite behind in their vaccinations rates when placed into comparsion with Yukon + Northwest Terrorities. This is where a question of mine arises on to why that is the case? Knowing more additional information on Nunavut's political culture can help further explain the discrepancy why Nunanvut, although a terriority is evidently behind with the other territories. 

4. **The fourth figure is describing** how has mobility changed in Canada over the pandemic? The diagram showcases that most Canadians have resorted to attending parks significantly more than any other form of recreation. I can infer through the data that the high peak is majorly only during the months of Spring/Summer however. In additions, I can infer that mobility transit rates have decreased the most, whereas the rest have been more stagant on the baseline. A question of mine that would be intriguing to answer would be how has online service providers like (Amazon,EBAY, etc) played a factor in the change in mobility in Canada? Including additional information on a survey of Canadians on their experience with service providers like Amazon would be quite interesting to include in the data.
