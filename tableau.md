# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau


## 1. Mapping regional vaccination rates
> Q1: What is the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories?  

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/hshoker-covid-vaccinations-map/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 



#### Summary
The figure above analyzes the current state of vaccinations among provinces and territories. The image shows how the terrorities are significantly higher in their vaccinations per 100 people when placed into comparsion with the provinces.

## 2. Changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for provinces/territories
> Q2: How has travel to recreation and retail locations changed over time between regions of Canada?  

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/hshoker-recreation-retail-travel/Dashboard1?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 


#### Summary
The figure above looks at the changes in travel to retail and recreation destinations for the average of Ontario, and specficially PEI, Alberta, BC, Ontario, Quebec. PEI ranks significantly higher then the provinces selected.

## 3. Changes in travel to parks for Ontario counties/municipalities
> Q3: How has travel to parks changed over time in Ontario's counties/municipalities?  

<iframe seamless frameborder="0" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/hshoker-parks-ontario/Dashboard2?:embed=yes&:display_count=yes&:showVizHome=no" width = '650' height = '650' scrolling='no'></iframe> 


#### Summary
The figure above looks at the changes in travel to parks for Parry Sound District, Simcoe County, the Regional Municipality District of Peel, Regional Municipality District of York, and Toronto Division.

## 4. Reflection 
> 1. What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
> * I found Google Sheets much easier to use than Tableau, however I did enjoy the variety of services provided by Tableau. Google Sheets is definitely much more easier to navigate, and has a "sleek" look towards it. In terms of accessibility, Google Sheets would be the better option. However, Tableau allows for more effective analyazing. The options and services within Tableau allow an individual to truly dig in and think deeper of the dataset. Once you get the hang of Tableau, I feel professionals would much more prefer using Tableau than Google Sheets as it is much more effective for readers to understand. 

> 2. What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
> * Analayzing the first diagram, I can notice that most of the provinces are in a similar colour tone, whereas the terrorities are a complete seperate colour. This does come to a similar inference I made previously that the terrorities have done a much more effective job. I can also infer that in counties that have much more land space, there is much more travel mobility. For instance, Simcoe County has much natioanl parks and land which provides an understanding of why it is much higher than other districts like Parry Sound. 

> 3. What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
> * Some new questions I would ask is the political nature of the province and terriority. If a province is more conservative or more liberal, does that effect their vaccination rates? Or does it allow for more freedom in mobility to retail and recreation or freedom to more parks? Another question I would like to ask is looking at the population and comparing provinces with similar population against each other. This goes towards my next question of: 
> 4. How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 
> * I would definitely compare and contract provinces and terrorities dependent on the size of the population. In addition, I would merge both datasets to see that during the months of vaccinations, how mobility in certain parts of Ontario increased or decreased. That would be very interesting to see visually, if the vaccinations made people feel more comfortable in travelling more around their area or kept it the same.
